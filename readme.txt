A WordPress Cleaner that works while you get on with doing more important stuff.

== Description ==

> The Maid does WordPress optimization and cleaning for those that don't want to have to think about it.

= What makes The WP Maid different? =

It works, and it's designed and built by the same people that brought you the ultimate WordPress security and
management platform: iControlWP + Shield.

== Installation ==

See FAQs.

== Installation ==

Note: When you enable the plugin, the firewall is not automatically turned on. This plugin contains various different sections of
protection for your site and you should choose which you need based on your own requirements.

Why do we do this? It's simple: performance and optimization - there is no reason to automatically turn on features for people that don't
need it as each site and set of requirements is different.

This plugin should install as any other WordPress.org respository plugin.

1.	Browse to Plugins -> Add Plugin
1.	Search: Shield
1.	Click Install
1.	Click to Activate.

A new menu item will appear on the left-hand side called 'Shield'.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
